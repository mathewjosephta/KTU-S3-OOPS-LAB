# S3-OOPS Lab Programs (KTU 2019 SCHEME)

This repository contains the Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS) lab programs for Semester 3, as per the KTU syllabus(2019 scheme). The programs are implemented in **Java** and cover various fundamental OOPS concepts.

## About
The programs in this repository demonstrate core OOPS concepts, including:
- Classes and Objects
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Abstract Classes
- Exception Handling
- File Handling etc.

## Program List
1. **Program 1**: Write a Java program that checks whether a given string is a palindrome or not. Ex: MALAYALAM is palindrome. [Click Here!](https://github.com/mathewjosephta/KTU-S3-OOPS-LAB/blob/main/StringPalindrome1.java)

2. **Program 2**: Write a Java Program to find the frequency of a given character in a string.

3. **Program 3**: Write a Java program to multiply two given matrices.

4. **Program 4**: Write a Java program which creates a class named 'Employee' having the following members: Name, Age, Phone number, Address, Salary. It also has a method 
                  named 'printSalary( )' which prints the salary of the Employee. Two classes 'Officer' and 'Manager' inherits the 'Employee' class. The 'Officer' and 
                 'Manager' classes have data members 'specialization' and 'department' respectively. Now, assign name, age, phone number, address and salary to an officer 
                  and a manager by making an object of both of these classes and print the same. (Exercise to understand inheritance).

5. **Program 5**: Write a java program to create an abstract class named Shape that contains an empty method named numberOfSides( ). Provide three classes named Rectangle, 
                  Triangle and Hexagon such that each one of the classes extends the class Shape. Each one of the classes contains only the method numberOfSides( ) that 
                  shows the number of sides in the given geometrical structures. (Exercise to understand polymorphism).

6. **Program 6**: Write a Java program to demonstrate the use of garbage collector.

7. **Program 7**: Write a file handling program in Java with reader/writer.

8. **Program 8**: Write a Java program that read from a file and write to file by handling all file related exceptions.

9. **Program 9**: Write a Java program that reads a line of integers, and then displays each integer, and the sum of all the integers (Use String Tokenizer class of 
                  java.util).

10. **Program 10**: Write a Java program that shows the usage of try, catch, throws and finally.

11. **Program 11**: Write a Java program that implements a multi-threaded program which has three threads. First thread generates a random integer every 1 second. If the 
                    value is even, second thread computes the square of the number and prints. If the value is odd the third thread will print the value of cube of the 
                    number.

12. **Program 12**: Write a Java program that shows thread synchronization.

13. **Program 13**: Write a Java program that works as a simple calculator. Arrange Buttons for digits and the + - * % operations properly. Add a text field to display the 
                    result. Handle any possible exceptions like divide by zero. Use Java Swing.

14.  **Program 14**: Write a Java program that simulates a traffic light. The program lets the user select one of three lights: red, yellow, or green. 
                     When a radio button is selected, the light is turned on, and only one light can be on at a time. No light is on when the program 
                     starts.

15.   **Program 15**: Write a Java program to display all records from a table using Java Database Connectivity (JDBC).

16.   **Program 16** : Write a Java program for the following: **
                             1) Create a doubly linked list of elements.
                             2) Delete a given element from the above list.
                             3) Display the contents of the list after deletion.

17.   **Program 17** :Write a Java program that implements Quick sort algorithm for sorting a list of names in ascending order.

18.   **Program 18** : Write a Java program that implements the binary search algorithm.
