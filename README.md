# S3-OOPS Lab Programs (KTU)

This repository contains the Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS) lab programs for Semester 3, as per the KTU syllabus(2019 scheme). The programs are implemented in **Java** and cover various fundamental OOPS concepts.

## About
The programs in this repository demonstrate core OOPS concepts, including:
- Classes and Objects
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Abstract Classes
- Exception Handling
- File Handling etc.

## Program List
1. **Program 1**: Write a java program to print "Hello World"
2. **Program 2**: write a java program to add two numbers(int , float and double ) from user input
3. **Program 3**: write a java program to print largest of three numbers
4. **Program 4**: Write a Java program that prints the Fibonacci series up to a specified number of terms
5. **Program 5**: Write a java program to check whether a 'NUMBER' is palindrome or not
6. **Program 6**: write a java program to check whether a 'STRING' is palindrome or not
7. **Program 7**: write a java program to check whether a number is armstrong or not
8. **Program 8**: Write a Java Program to find the frequency of a given character in a string.
9. **Program 9**: Write a java program find the transpose of a matrix
10. **Program 10**: Write a Java program to multiply two matrices
11. **Program 11**: Write a menu driven program to add or subtract two matrices
12. **Program 12**: write a Java program that calculates the volume of a box
13. **Program 13**: Write a Java program that reads the marks of 3 students using a constructor
14.  **Program 14**: (Exercise to understand inheritance).
15.   **Program 15**: (Exercise to understand polymorphism).
16.   **Program 16** : Write a Java program that reads a line of integers, and then displays each integer, and the
sum of all the integers (Use String Tokenizer class of java.util).
17.   **Program 17** :
18.   **Program 18** : Write a file handling program in Java with reader/writer.
19.   **Program 19** : Write a Java program that read from a file and write to file by handling all file related ex-
ceptions..
